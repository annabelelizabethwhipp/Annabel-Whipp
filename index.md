# Learning Resources

I produced a guide to getting started with ArcMap [here](https://github.com/annabelelizabethwhipp/LearningResources/blob/master/Getting%20started%20with%20ArcMap.pdf). It includes guidance on adding data, joining data, producing choropleth and graduated maps, and producing a layout.

[Here](https://github.com/annabelelizabethwhipp/LearningResources/blob/master/Geocoding%20Postcodes.pdf) is a guide to geocoding, focussing on deriving eastings and northings from postcodes. 

A guide to getting started with QGIS is available [here.](https://github.com/annabelelizabethwhipp/LearningResources/blob/master/Getting%20started%20with%20QGIS.pdf)
